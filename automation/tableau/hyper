What is Hyper: Hyper is Tableau's blazingly fast SQL engine powering Tableau's real time analytics and interactive exploration and Tableau Prep's ETL transformations.
 

Following are the steps to load data in Hyper file.

# Generate Hyper file from Tableau server and copy in local path.

from packages.hyper_file import HyperFile
parquet_folder = '<complete_folder_of_parquet_files_folder>'
parquet_extension = 'parquet' # Optional. Don't use it if the parquet files have no extension
hf = HyperFile(parquet_folder)
hyper_filename = "<complete_path_of_hyper_file>"
rows  = hf.append_rows(hyper_filename)
print(f'{rows} were appended.')

Limitation: it only runs on local file-system

 
#Tableau #hyper #parquet_to_hyper #delta_to_hyper
